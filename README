=head1 INTRODUCTION

Please see the INSTALLATION section below for build instructions.

This module provides access to the administrative functions of DB2 for
Linux, Unix and Windows.  The administrative functions are those
functions not accessible through SQL, which normally require use of
the DB2 command line processor (the "db2" command).  IBM has been
making some of these available through administrative view and the
SYSPROC.ADMIN_CMD stored procedure.

Using these functions from perl is faster and can provide more
detailed results than the command-line processor.  For example, when
reading configuration parameters, the administrative API will not just
tell you which values are set to "automatic", but also which options
support the "automatic" setting.  In a similar manner, when loading
data into a DPF database, the API returns detailed information for
each node and agent, allowing far more fine-grained error handling.

The DB2 administrative function module provides the following
functionality:

=over

=item *

Monitoring: get snapshot information and read event monitor files

=item *

Bulk data transfer: export, import, load

=item *

Configuration: get/set instance and database level configuration parameters

=item *

Directory: read or modify the database, node and DCS directory

=item *

Utilities: force applications, runstats, rebind, list history, list utilities

=head1 INSTALLATION

This module can only be installed if you have the C compiler used to
build perl itself, plus a version of DB2 with the header files
installed (the developer's edition).  You generally cannot build this
module if you've downloaded a pre-compiled version of perl.

You need to run the test portions under a userid with DB2
system administration privileges.

Make sure the pre-requisite module Params::Validate has been
installed.

As a first step, set the environment variable DB2_VERSION to the DB2
release you have installed.  For example, if you're running DB2 Viper
(V9.1), do:

  export DB2_VERSION=V9.1

If you're not on Linux, Solaris or AIX (or if you've installed DB2 in
a different location than the Makefile.PL file expects), you also have
to specify the path where the DB2 files can be found, for example:

  export DB2_PREFIX=/opt/IBM/db2/V9.1

The common environment variables DB2DIR and DB2_HOME can be used as
well.

Please report the default prefix for platforms that the author doesn't
have access to (i.e. not Linux, Solaris), so the module can support
them in the future.

Then do:

  perl Makefile.PL
  make

The test step requires you to create a SAMPLE database with a set of
tables used for the export, import and load tests.  The supplied
"create_test_db" script will create the SAMPLE database using the
IBM-supplied "db2sampl" utility and create some additional tables.
Make sure you have sourced the DB2 environment before running the
script.

  create_test_db
  make test

You can run the tests against any other database you want, but please
make sure you update the CONFIG file before running the test script.

Once the test completes, you can install the module with:

  make install
