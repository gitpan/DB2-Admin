Please see the INSTALLATION section below for build instructions.

This module provides access to the administrative functions of DB2 for
Linux, Unix and Windows. The administrative functions are those functions
not accessible through SQL, which normally require use of the DB2 command
line processor (the ``db2'' command). IBM has been making some of these
available through administrative view and the SYSPROC.ADMIN_CMD stored
procedure.


<P>

Using these functions from perl is faster and can provide more detailed
results than the command-line processor. For example, when reading
configuration parameters, the administrative API will not just tell you
which values are set to ``automatic'', but also which options support the
``automatic'' setting. In a similar manner, when loading data into a DPF
database, the API returns detailed information for each node and agent,
allowing far more fine-grained error handling.


<P>

The DB2 administrative function module provides the following
functionality:

This module can only be installed if you have the C compiler used to build
perl itself, plus a version of DB2 with the header files installed (the
developer's edition). You generally cannot build this module if you've
downloaded a pre-compiled version of perl.


<P>

You need to run the test portions under a userid with DB2 system
administration privileges.


<P>

As a first step, set the environment variable DB2_VERSION to the DB2
release you have installed. For example, if you're running DB2 Viper
(V9.1), do:


<P>

<PRE>  export DB2_VERSION=V9.1
</PRE>

<P>

If you're not on Linux or Solaris (or if you've installed DB2 in a
different location than the Makefile.PL file expects), you also have to
specify the path where the DB2 files can be found, for example:


<P>

<PRE>  export DB2_PREFIX=/opt/IBM/db2/V9.1
</PRE>

<P>

Please report the default prefix for platforms that the author doesn't have
access to (i.e. not Linux, Solaris), so the module can support them in the
future.


<P>

Then do:


<P>

<PRE>  perl Makefile.PL
  make
</PRE>

<P>

The test step requires you to create a SAMPLE database with a set of tables
used for the export, import and load tests. The supplied ``create_test_db''
script will create the SAMPLE database using the IBM-supplied ``db2sampl''
utility and create some additional tables. Make sure you have sourced the
DB2 environment before running the script.


<P>

<PRE>  create_test_db
  make test
</PRE>

<P>

You can run the tests against any other database you want, but please make
sure you update the CONFIG file before running the test script.


<P>

Once the test completes, you can install the module with:


<P>

<PRE>  make install
</PRE>
